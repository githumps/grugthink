# Grug's Security Cave (Security Policy)

Grug wants his cave to be safe for all. If you find a bad spirit (security vulnerability) in Grug's code, please tell Grug chief (project maintainer) right away.

## How to Tell Grug About Bad Spirits

Do NOT tell Grug about bad spirits in public. Do NOT make a new issue on the big rock pile (GitHub Issues).

Instead, send a secret message to the chief.

## What to Tell Grug

When you send the secret message, tell Grug these things:

*   **Where the bad spirit lives:** Which part of Grug's code has the problem.
*   **How the bad spirit works:** Steps to make the bad spirit appear.
*   **What the bad spirit does:** How it hurts Grug or other cavemen.
*   **Your name (optional):** If you want Grug to know who found the bad spirit.

## What Grug Will Do

Grug chief will:

1.  Tell you Grug got your message in two sunrises.
2.  Look at the bad spirit and see how strong it is.
3.  Fix the bad spirit quickly.
4.  Tell you when the bad spirit is gone.

Grug thanks you for helping keep the cave safe!
