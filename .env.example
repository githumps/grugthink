# ⚠️  DEPRECATED: .env file configuration is no longer used!
# 
# GrugThink now uses a single YAML configuration file instead.
# Please use 'grugthink_config.yaml' for all configuration.
#
# To get started:
# 1. cp grugthink_config.yaml.example grugthink_config.yaml
# 2. Edit grugthink_config.yaml with your settings
# 3. Remove this .env file
#
# This file is kept only for reference during migration.
#
# See README.md for complete setup instructions.
