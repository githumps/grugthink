# Security Policy

We take the security of GrugThink seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly so we can address it promptly.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing the project maintainers directly or using GitHub's private security advisory feature.

## Vulnerability Report Guidelines

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

*   **Location:** Which component or file contains the vulnerability
*   **Description:** Clear explanation of the vulnerability and potential impact
*   **Reproduction Steps:** Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
*   **Proof of Concept:** If possible, provide a minimal example demonstrating the vulnerability
*   **Suggested Fix:** If you have ideas for remediation, please include them

## Security Response Process

Our security response process:

1.  **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2.  **Assessment:** We will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity
3.  **Fix Development:** We will develop and test a fix for the vulnerability
4.  **Disclosure:** We will coordinate disclosure with you and provide credit if desired

## Security Considerations in GrugThink

### Data Protection
- **User Privacy**: User IDs are logged instead of usernames to protect privacy
- **Content Security**: Message content lengths are logged instead of actual content
- **Token Security**: All API tokens and secrets must be stored in environment variables

### Bot Security
- **Permission Isolation**: Each Discord server maintains isolated personality and fact databases
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting prevents abuse of verification commands
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized before processing

### Deployment Security
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration stored in .env files (never committed)
- **Docker Security**: Multi-stage builds minimize attack surface in production images
- **Dependencies**: Regular dependency updates to address known vulnerabilities

### API Security
- **Authentication**: Proper API key validation for Gemini and Google Search APIs
- **Network Security**: All external API calls use HTTPS encryption
- **Error Handling**: Error messages don't expose sensitive system information

## Security Updates

Security fixes will be released as soon as possible after confirmation. Critical vulnerabilities may result in emergency releases outside the normal release schedule.
