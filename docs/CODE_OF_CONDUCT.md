# Grug's Tribe Rules (Code of Conduct)

Grug's cave is a place for all cavemen to be safe and strong. We follow these rules to make sure everyone feels welcome and respected.

## Our Promise

We promise to make Grug's cave a place free from bad words, bad actions, and bad feelings. Everyone should feel safe to speak and share.

## Our Rules

*   **Be Kind:** Speak with good words. Do not hurt feelings. Treat others how you want to be treated.
*   **Be Respectful:** Listen to other cavemen. Their ideas are important, even if different from yours.
*   **No Bad Words:** Do not use words that make others feel small, scared, or unwelcome. No fighting words, no mean words about how someone looks or where they come from.
*   **No Bad Actions:** Do not touch others without asking. Do not follow others. Do not make others feel unsafe.
*   **Share Wisely:** Share your ideas, but do not shout over others. Let everyone speak.

## If Rules Are Broken

If you see bad things, or feel unsafe, tell the chief (project maintainer) right away. The chief will listen and make things right. All reports will be kept secret.

## Chief's Promise

The chief will make sure these rules are followed. If a caveman breaks the rules, the chief will talk to them. If bad actions continue, the caveman may be asked to leave Grug's tribe.
